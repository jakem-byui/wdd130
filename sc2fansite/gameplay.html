                <h1 class="l-gameplay-content-header">Gathering Resources</h1>
                <p class="l-gameplay-content">In StarCraft 2, gathering resources efficiently is a fundamental 
                    aspect of gameplay. Players must strategically manage their 
                    workers, typically known as SCVs (Terran), Drones (Zerg), or 
                    Probes (Protoss), to harvest minerals and vespene gas. These 
                    resources are vital for constructing buildings, training units, 
                    and researching upgrades. Resource nodes are scattered throughout 
                    the map, and players must allocate their workers accordingly to 
                    maximize extraction rates. Balancing resource gathering with 
                    other strategic actions is essential for maintaining a strong 
                    economy and ensuring a steady supply of units and upgrades. 
                    Effective resource management is key to success in StarCraft 2, 
                    enabling players to establish a robust infrastructure and unleash 
                    their strategic might on the battlefield.</p>

                <h1 class="r-gameplay-content-header">Building Your Base</h1>
                <p class="r-gameplay-content">Building a formidable base is a crucial aspect of StarCraft 2 
                    gameplay. Players strategically construct buildings to support 
                    their faction's unique needs. These structures serve various 
                    purposes, such as producing units, researching technologies, 
                    and upgrading abilities. Careful base placement is essential, 
                    considering factors like defensive positioning, resource 
                    proximity, and expansion opportunities. The base acts as a 
                    hub for resource collection and unit production, enabling 
                    players to reinforce their armies and launch strategic attacks. 
                    Balancing base expansion, defense, and resource management is 
                    vital for establishing a solid foundation and gaining an 
                    advantage over opponents. A well-designed base is the 
                    cornerstone of success in StarCraft 2's intense battles.</p>

                <h1 class="l-gameplay-content-header">Epic Battles</h1>
                <p class="l-gameplay-content">In the epic battles of StarCraft 2, large armies clash in a 
                    breathtaking display of strategy and skill. Commanders maneuver 
                    their diverse forces, comprising a multitude of units and 
                    specialized abilities, across the battlefield. As massive armies 
                    engage, explosions illuminate the screen, and the sound of weapons 
                    and abilities reverberates. Micro-management becomes crucial as 
                    players position units, utilize abilities, and coordinate attacks 
                    to exploit enemy weaknesses. The chaos of battle requires split-
                    second decision-making, quick reflexes, and a deep understanding 
                    of unit strengths and weaknesses. Watching large armies clash in 
                    StarCraft 2 is a spectacle that showcases the pinnacle of strategic 
                    warfare in the vastness of space.</p>
