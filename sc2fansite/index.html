                <h2>Where It All Started</h2>
                <p>The journey of StarCraft 2 began with its predecessor, 
                    the groundbreaking StarCraft, which debuted in 1998. 
                    With its compelling storyline, diverse factions, and 
                    intense multiplayer battles, StarCraft set a new standard 
                    for real-time strategy games. Players became engrossed 
                    in the galactic conflict between the human Terrans, the 
                    insectoid Zerg, and the advanced Protoss, forging a 
                    devoted fanbase that persists to this day.</p>

                <h2>StarCraft 2</h2>
                <p>Fast forward to 2010, and Blizzard Entertainment unleashed 
                    StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty, the highly anticipated 
                    sequel that took the gaming world by storm. Building upon 
                    the foundation of the original game, StarCraft 2 introduced 
                    stunning graphics, refined gameplay mechanics, and an 
                    engrossing continuation of the saga. The single-player 
                    campaign, centered around the heroic Terran commander 
                    Jim Raynor, captivated players with its rich narrative 
                    and strategic challenges.</p>

                    expanded further with two additional expansions, Heart of 
                    the Swarm and Legacy of the Void, each focusing on one of 
                    the other dominant factions. These expansions brought new
